# Cub3D #

## Introduction ##

The project is inspired by the game Wolfeinstein3D, considered as the first ever FPS. It uses ray-casting to simulate a 3d environment. The goal is to have a dynamic field of view in a maze, where you can move as you wish.
The list of maps is in `map` folder.

You can try the original game on this link :

### Requirements ###

Use only the following functions :

- open, close, read, write,
printf, malloc, free,
perror, strerror, exit
- Toutes les fonctions de
la lib math (-lm man man 3
math)
- Toutes les fonctions de la MinilibX

## How does it work ##

Ray casting is the most basic of many computer graphics rendering algorithms that use the geometric algorithm of ray tracing. Ray tracing-based rendering algorithms operate in image order to render three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional images. Geometric rays are traced from the eye of the observer to sample the light travelling toward the observer from the ray direction.
The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray—think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.

## How to start the game ##

Just start it using :

```sh
./cub3d <PATH_to_MAP/><MAP>
```

`PATH_to_MAP` is the PATH where is stored the map.

`MAP` is the map file, with the `.cub` extension.

## How to play ##

The controls of the player are the following :

`W_KEY` and `S_KEY` for walking and stepping back.

`A_KEY` and `D_KEY` for rotation.

### How to end the game ###

There is no end, you can just walk around and see the projection in a all the scenario that you can think of.
You can try to create the most intricate design and see the result.

## MAP Rules ##

You can see the rules of the map in the documentation folder.
In the `map/` folder, there is also invalid maps to help you understand what is autorized and what isn't.

## Bonuses ##

/!\⚠️ WIP or not even started ⚠️/!\

- Collisions on wall (no clipping) ⚠️/!\
- A minimap HUD (to know where you are) ⚠️/!\
- Windows resolution settings and full-screen ⚠️/!\
- Anti-Aliasing (makes the edges smoother for cleaner lines) ⚠️/!\
